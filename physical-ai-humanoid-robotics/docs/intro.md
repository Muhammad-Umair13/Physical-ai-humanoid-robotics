# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

Welcome to the comprehensive textbook on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics! This textbook is designed to provide you with a deep understanding of the fundamental concepts, technologies, and practical applications in the field of humanoid robotics.

## About This Textbook

This textbook is structured into four comprehensive modules:

- **Module 1: ROS 2** - Learn the Robot Operating System 2, including nodes, topics, services, actions, and how to build robotic applications
- **Module 2: Digital Twin** - Explore simulation environments with Gazebo and Unity for robotics development
- **Module 3: AI-Robot Brain** - Understand AI integration in robotics using NVIDIA Isaac, VSLAM, navigation, and locomotion
- **Module 4: VLA (Vision-Language-Action)** - Integrate voice commands, LLM planning, and create a capstone autonomous humanoid project

## Interactive Learning

This textbook features an integrated RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot that allows you to select text and ask questions directly related to the content. Simply select any text in the textbook and click the floating AI Assistant button to ask questions about that specific content.

## Target Audience

This textbook is designed for:
- AI and robotics students
- Researchers in robotics and AI
- Practitioners with a computer science or engineering background
- Anyone interested in learning about Physical AI and humanoid robotics

## Learning Approach

Each module combines theoretical foundations with practical applications:
- Detailed explanations of concepts
